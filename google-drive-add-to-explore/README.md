# This package adds the Google Drive folder to the explorer sidebar like onedrive or dropbox

For those of you who use OneDrive or Dropbox you may have noticed that they create non-removable shortcuts in the Explorer sidebar.
If you are also a Google Drive user you&#39;ll notice that Google Drive doesn&#39;t create the same shortcuts.
This package will add this shortcut in using registry values.
